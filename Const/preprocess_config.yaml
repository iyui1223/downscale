# Configuration file for data preprocessing
# This file controls the slicing and processing of training and target data
#
# NOTE: Spatial/temporal bounds and data directories are centralized in:
#       Const/env_setting.sh (LAT_MIN, LAT_MAX, LON_MIN, LON_MAX, TIME_START, TIME_END)
#       Those environment variables override any values specified here.

# Training data configuration (e.g., ERA5)
training:
  # File pattern to match NetCDF files
  file_pattern: "*.nc"
  
  # Variable name in NetCDF file (leave null to load all variables)
  # Common names: t2m, t2m_max, tmax, air_temperature
  variable_name: null
  
  # Output filename (without extension)
  output_name: "training_era5_tmax"
  
  # Save format: 'npz' (compressed numpy) or 'zarr'
  # npz: Good for datasets that fit in memory, simple to use
  # zarr: Better for very large datasets, supports lazy loading
  save_format: "npz"
  
  # Chunk size for time dimension (for memory-efficient processing)
  time_chunk: 365

# Target data configuration (e.g., MSWX, observations)
target:
  # File pattern to match NetCDF files
  file_pattern: "*.nc"
  
  # Variable name in NetCDF file
  variable_name: null
  
  # Output filename (without extension)
  output_name: "target_mswx_tmax"
  
  # Save format
  save_format: "npz"
  
  # Chunk size for time dimension
  time_chunk: 365

# Processing options
processing:
  # Compression level (for zarr format, 0-9, higher = more compression)
  compression_level: 5
